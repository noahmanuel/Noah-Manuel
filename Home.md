# Noah Manuel
<p>Hello! My name is Noah Manuel. I'm a biologist and Masters Student in the EEB Department at the University of Connecticut! I'm originally from Newport, Rhode Island where my love of the natural world began by living by the sea!</p>
<p>I attended Saint Anslem College for my undergraduated studies in Manchester, New Hampshire where I majored in Biology and minored in Chemistry. While there I conducted a study, for my Senior Honors Thesis, where I collected over 130 different flowering plant specimens in order to create a flora for the College. I also sung tenor in the College Choir and worked as a Resident Assistant during my time on the Hilltop! In 2023, I graduated Suma Cum Laude from Saint Anselm with a Honors Bachelors of Science in Biology. </p>
<p>After completing my Masters, I plan to obtain my PhD in order to become a professor of biology so I can teach students about the beauty of the natural world! </p>
